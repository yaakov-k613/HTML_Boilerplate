    <h1>The Best Blog Examples Of 2025</h1>
    <h6>Written By Steve Benjamins</h6>

    <p>In this collection, we share a whole variety of blogs — variety in terms of:</p>
    <p>Types of blogs: lifestyle blogs, photography blogs, company blogs, ecommerce brand blogs, travel blogs, food blogs, fitness blogs, personal blogs, and more.
Platforms they use: Some blogs are made with general-purpose website builders like Squarespace and Wix, some use CMSs like WordPress, and some have preferred specialty blogging platforms like Ghost.
Design: All blog designs are simple and comfortable enough that they do not hinder the reader’s experience. Yet, they have different presentations and relevant design styles that match the stories told. For example, a finance blog will have a simple, austere design to communicate seriousness and clarity. A parenting blog will be whimsical and cartoonish to suggest fun and relatability.
Success: Depending on the example, blog success means a different thing. Some blogs in this collection nail SEO and get massive organic traffic, while some are personal and only read by friends and family. Some are there to showcase authority to potential clients, while some are there for the education of existing customers.
Monetization: Some blogs are monetized with ads and affiliate links, while some sell a product or service. And some are not monetized at all.
Check these blog examples to start your blogging journey!
